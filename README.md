# Module 10: Loops and Functions

**Part 1: Work through R4DS Chapter 19, Functions**
- Required: [R4DS Chapter 19, Functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html)

**Part 2: Watch the loops videos and follow along with the exercise**
- Watch the video [here](https://youtu.be/).

**Part 3: Complete homework exercises**

The following exercises should be completed in a R script. You will not be submitting this R script for a grade, but these exercises and the code you prepare to work through the exercises **will** be the focus of a quiz question(s).  

The output associated with the correct code for each exercise is shown at the bottom of the exercise webpages (under the `[click here for output]` hyperlink). The output is provided so you can check the accuracy of your code. You are welcome to work with others on these exercises. 

Happy coding!
